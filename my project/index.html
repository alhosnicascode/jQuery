        <h2>1. Procedural programming languages</h2>
        <p>A procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in order to achieve a desired output. Each series of steps is called a procedure, and a program written in one of these languages will have one or more procedures within it. Common examples of procedural languages include:

         </p>

        <p>C and C++
          <br>
          Java
          <br>
          Pascal
          <br>
          BASIC</p>

        <h2>2. Functional programming languages</h2>
        <p>Rather than focusing on the execution of statements, functional languages focus on the output of mathematical functions and evaluations. Each function–a reusable module of code–performs a specific task and returns a result. The result will vary depending on what data you input into the function. Some popular functional programming languages include:</p>

        <p>Scala
          <br>
         Erlang
         <br>
         Haskell
         <br>
         Elixir
         <br>
         F#</p>

        <h2>3. Object-oriented programming languages</h2>
        <p>This type of language treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements, known as attributes and methods. Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs. This makes it a popular language type for complex programs, as code is easier to reuse and scale. Some common object-oriented programming (OOP) languages include:</p>

        <p>Java
         <br>
          Python
          <br>
          PHP

          C++

        <h2>4. Scripting languages</h2>
        <p>Programmers use scripting languages to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications. Some common scripting languages include:</p>

        <p>PHP

          Ruby
          <br>
          Python

        <h2>5. Logic programming languages</h2>
        <p>Instead of telling a computer what to do, a logic programming language expresses a series of facts and rules to instruct the computer on how to make decisions. Some examples of logic languages include:.</p>
